I did not work with any other students on this assignment. I primarily used class resources and examples. 

In order to figure out how to convert a previously converted string with a dollar sign back to a float (in box 79 of the code ), I used the following website: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32464280/converting-currency-with-to-numbers-in-python-pandas

I also perused a few forums to troubleshoot an error I was getting, but they weren't really helpful. I realized it was a basic syntax issue.
